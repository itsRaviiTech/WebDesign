# üìò Online Quiz System

## üìù Project Overview

The Online Quiz System is a web-based application designed for the education industry, specifically targeting schools, universities, and online learning platforms. The goal of this system is to streamline the process of conducting quizzes, tracking student performance, and managing question banks in a centralized, accessible platform.

In traditional classroom or e-learning environments, teachers often face challenges in preparing, distributing, and grading quizzes manually or through non-integrated tools like printed forms or spreadsheets. Similarly, students may struggle to access quizzes on time or receive timely feedback on their performance.

This application addresses these problems by providing a dynamic quiz management solution with role-based access for teachers and students. Teachers can create and manage quizzes, assign them to students, and monitor individual performance, while students can access available quizzes, submit their answers, and instantly view their results.

The system enhances educational efficiency, reduces administrative workload, and supports data-driven decision-making in learning environments.
